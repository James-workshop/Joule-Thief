##What Is A Joule Thief ?
A joule thief is a minimalist self-oscillating voltage booster that is small, low-cost, and easy to build, typically used for driving small loads. 

It can use nearly all of the energy in a single-cell electric battery, even far below the voltage where other circuits consider the battery fully discharged (or "dead"); hence the name, which suggests the notion that the circuit is stealing energy 

The circuit is a variant of the blocking oscillator that forms an unregulated voltage boost converter. The output voltage is increased at the expense of higher current draw on the input, but the integrated (average) current of the output is lowered and brightness of a luminescence decreased.


##How is this Joule Thief different?
Unlike most other joule thief circuits, this circuit uses a standard inductor. Hence there is no need to salvage a toroid and wind wire away to glory.

The circuit is super simple, can easily be assembled on a breadboard, or can be soldered onto really tiny PCBs, if you want...



For simplicity and beauty, I made PCB for it

Here is a record of my production process.
